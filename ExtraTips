Welcome to my extra tips!

- 1) Once I completed the tutorial, how can I install apps?
      Good question! There are 2 tutorials that are insanely easy and I'd recommend everyone to watch.

- 2) Watch out your for battery ðŸª«ðŸ‘€
      If your battery is about to die or you're about to completely turn off your phone,
      make sure you disable wifi and mobile data. When the phone restarts, wait around
      30 seconds before you re-enable them. This is because, when you restrat your phone,
      Apple tries to check your apps before your DNS is turned back off. Just follow the
      procedures above and you'll be fine.

- 3) DO NOT USE VPNS
      VPNs interfere with the BreakFree DNS that blocks Apple, and using them WILL lead to Apple 
      blocking you from sideloading. Therefore, avoid VPNS.
