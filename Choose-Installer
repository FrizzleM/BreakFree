# What installer should I pick?

Good question, here are my favorite installers:
- 🔜 Portal
(Coming soon in v1.4 👀)

- ✅ Feather
The best option for new users in 2025.
It is constantly updated with user requested features, 
does not track your data (unlike ESign) and has a much more user friendly interface. 
The best for beginners. There are some missing features, but they are secondary, therefore unnecessary, 
and the dev is actually gradually adding most of the user requested features.

- ⚠️ ESign
This signer is being discontinued by its dev, as well as WSF. Therefore, I have made the hard decision to discontinue its support in the next update of BreakFree. In v1.4, ESign will no longer be supported. 
Other than that, it's a nice option. It is not the most user friendly, but it is quick, free and customizable as much as you would ever want. 
Although, it does lack a bit of optimization in its UI. 

- ❌ Scarlet
Might sound controversial, but for me it's a no go, which is why it is not in my shortcut nor am I planning on adding it. 
There are many reasons, but the major ones are the lack of maintainance, the various bugs for iOS 18, a
nd the suspicions users have had regarding data collection. It also lacks customizability, just avoid it.
