# BreakFree
![IMG_0148](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f41246e5-a3e1-4c1f-bdf2-cf4ae1068844)

A free iOS shortcut that lets you sideload unlimited apps on your iOS and iPadOS device using a DNS and public certificates (given by WSF).
It works by applying WSF's DNS and using WSF's Portal app to install an installer.

## How does it work?
This shortcut takes different developer certificates leaked from different companies, and uses them on your device. This makes it look like you're part of that company, testing their apps, when you're actually using it for your needs. Apple patched this in 2016 with iOS 10, but users recently realized you can get over the patch by using DNSs, which blocks Apple from spying on you. This is exactly what this shortcut does.

## Is my device compatible?
Is your device an iPhone or an iPad? Is your device running from iOS 16 to the latest? If both answers are yes, it is compatible.
A version higher than iOS 16 is needed, unfortunately this won't work with devices under iOS 16. Still, if your version is that old, there is Trollstore or jailbreak options you could consider using. They can do the same if not more.

## Where can I download it?
You can find it in the [Releases](https://github.com/FrizzleM/BreakFree/releases) section.
It is also available in my [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/21677/)

## What are you planning on adding in future versions?
BreakFree is getting its biggest update yet in the next update, v1.4. The entire checkpoint system has been restructured for a smoother and more logical flow. A brand new app called Portal replaces E-Sign, making the sideloading process much easier, especially for beginners. The DNS has been rebuilt from the ground up to improve protection, internet speed, and battery life. A new video guide has also been made to match the new steps. This update took a while to finish, but the improvements make it more than worth the wait. The beta is available now on GitHub, and the full release is coming soon.
