A free iOS shortcut that lets you sideload unlimited apps on your iOS and iPadOS device using a DNS and public certificates (given by WSF).
It works by applying an Apple-blocking DNS and using Enterprise Certificates to install applications.

## How does it work?
This shortcut takes different developer certificates leaked from different companies, and uses them on your device. This makes it look like you're part of that company, testing their apps, when you're actually using it for your needs. Apple patched this in 2016 with iOS 10, but users recently realized you can get over the patch by using DNSs, which blocks Apple from spying on you. This is exactly what this shortcut does.

## Is my device compatible?
Is your device an iPhone or an iPad? Is your device running from iOS 16 to the latest? If both answers are yes, it is compatible.
A version higher than iOS 16 is needed, unfortunately this won't work with devices under iOS 16. Still, if your version is that old, there are Trollstore or jailbreak options you could consider using. They can do the same if not more.

## Where can I download it?
You can find it in the [Releases](https://github.com/FrizzleM/BreakFree/releases) section.
It is also available in my [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/21677/)

## iOS 26.X.X just released, is it still compatible?
This method uses the Apple Developer Program and DNSs, two key features that Apple has no plans of removing. Therefore, this method should work on any version, no matter how new it is. Still, the latest tested version where it works is currently iOS 26.0.1.
