# BreakFree

A free iOS shortcut that lets you sideload unlimited apps on your iOS and iPadOS device using a DNS and public certificates (given by WSF).
It works by applying WSF's DNS and using WSF's Portal app to install an installer.

## How does it work?
This shortcut takes different developer certificates leaked from different companies, and uses them on your device. This makes it look like you're part of that company, testing their apps, when you're actually using it for your needs. Apple patched this in 2016 with iOS 10, but users recently realized you can get over the patch by using DNSs, which blocks Apple from spying on you. This is exactly what this shortcut does.

## Is my device compatible?
Is your device an iPhone or an iPad? Is your device running on iOS 16 or any version that was released after that? If both answers are yes, it is compatible.
A version older than iOS 16 is needed, unfortunately this won't work with devices under iOS 16. Still, if your version is that old, there is Trollstore or jailbreak options you could consider using. They can do the same if not more.

## Where can I download it?
You can find it in the Releases section.
It is also available in my [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/21677/)

## What are you planning on adding in future versions?
In the next updates, I am planning on making the process as fast and user friendly as possible. If there's any section that you find too complex, let me know and I will try explaining
it better. I will also try fixing bugs/typos and adding any feature requested by the community.
